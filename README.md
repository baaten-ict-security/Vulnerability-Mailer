# Vulnerability-Mailer
######
This script checks the Advisories RSS feed of NCSC.nl and sends an e-mail to a specified group of people when a new HIGH/HIGH vulnerability is detected.
## Things to be aware of: 
- The script assumes that all files are in /opt/scripts/vulnmailer/ 
- The script reads e-mailaddresses from vulnmailer-addresses.txt
- The script reads the timestamp from the last check from vulnmailer-lastchecked.txt
- Since the RSS feed's history is limited, it's best to run the script on a daily basis

You can configure this script to run every day at 10:00 by the following cronjob:
0 10 * * * root /usr/bin/python3.9 /opt/scripts/vulnmailer/vulnmailer.py > /dev/null 2>&1
